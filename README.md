# Stickers

Stickers is a fun and colorful Rails and Javascript Application for Parents to create Tasks for Children to complete. Upon completion of the Tasks the Children are rewarded with digital Stickers to add to their Stickers Collection, and Sticker Points which they can use to purchase Prizes created for them by their Parents.

## Installation

1. Fork the repository and clone it.
2. Run `bundle install` to install gems (If you don't have bundler, first run `gem install bundler`)
3. Set up the database with `rake db:dcms`. This will drop, create, migrate the database, and then launch a Rails server automatically. 
6. Open Index.html in stickers-js-api-frontend.
7. Be sure to create both Adult and Child Users on the same computer to save them properly for Task and Prize creation later.
